#+TODO: TODO STARTED | DONE FOLLOWUP ONGOING 

* Startup
** DONE Install vim-organizer plugin
   :CLOSED: <2014-12-09 Tue>
*** Main plugin
    [[https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer][VimOrganizer]]
*** Extra plugins required
   [[https://github.com/vim-scripts/utl.vim][vim-scripts/utl.vim]]

** DONE Publish a git repo for the timeline
   :CLOSED: <2014-12-10 Wed>
** VimOrganizer reading
*** DONE Read through the org-mode manual
    :CLOSED: <2014-12-09 Tue>
    [[http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][orgmode manual]]
    VimOrganizer is pretty poorly documented - orgmode docs give a much 
    clearer idea of how things work.
*** DONE Read through the VimOrganizer docs
   :CLOSED: <2014-12-10 Wed>
   [[https://github.com/hsitz/VimOrganizer/blob/master/doc/vimorg.txt][VimOrganizer]]
   Reference for vim specific keybindings etc.
*** TODO Find a way to handle recurring deadlines
   Mostly for blogging - can do it in orgmode I think, possible in VO?
*** ONGOING Add extra todo states
    FOLLOWUP - Used to mark the internal docs that I haven't checked yet but that 
    may need to be updated
    ONGOING - Projects that have no end date but will be worked on for the 
    duration (like this one)
    STARTED - Single projects that are incomplete (as distinct from ONGOING)
**** Adding extra todo states
     Can either be done globally via vimrc (not great for collaboration) or 
     locally per file via configuration lines at the topp of the document.
     #+begin-src 
     #+TODO: TODO STARTED | DONE FOLLOWUP ONGOING
     #+end_src
     Note that for some reason amending the config lines requires restarting 
     gvim to take effect. Not just a reload, but actually restarting gvim. No 
     clue why - maybe reloads don't work the same outside of the terminal. 
*** TODO Put together a more succinct cheat sheet for vim keybindings
* OPW Admin
** TODO Write blog post
   :recurring
   :DEADLINE: <2014-12-12 Fri>
   Notes on [[https://misspindy.org/apocalypse/Notes][MissPindy wiki]] 
   regarding initial contribution and application process. Could be 
   interesting to future applicants.
* Documentation
** TODO Finish updating Readme.md
   :SCHEDULED: <2014-12-11 Thu>
*** TODO Write an introduction section
*** TODO Revise the structure
    From wiki: Structure doesn't seem super logical. Should the dev section be at the top? Doesn't seem up-to-date-either. 
*** TODO Licensing documentation
    Usually separate from the readme, not sure if it needs to be but it makes 
    sense.
** TODO Read through the documentation for setting up debbugs
   :SCHEDULED: <2014-12-13 Sat>
   Refer to the bug lodged a few weeks ago
** TODO Research
*** TODO Document the documentation
    What is already there? What is most urgent (bug reports as first port of 
    call)? From that we can work out priorities and scheduling etc.
